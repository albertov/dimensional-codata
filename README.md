# dimensional-codata
CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants, 
for use with the [dimensional](https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional) library.

This module offers a selection of fundamental physical constants with their values as defined or measured
and published by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science.

These values are from the 2014 CODATA recommended values, by way of NIST.

The original document offers many, many more constants than are provided here. An effort has been made to narrow it
down to the most useful ones. If your work requires others or if you have another contribution or suggestion, please
submit issues or pull requests to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmcclean/dimensional-codata).
